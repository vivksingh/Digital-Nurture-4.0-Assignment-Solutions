## Exercise 2: E-commerce Platform Search Function

# Scenario: 
You are working on the search functionality of an e-commerce platform. The search needs to be optimized for fast performance.

# Steps:
1.	Understand Asymptotic Notation:
o	Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
o	Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
2.	Setup:
o	Create a class Product with attributes for searching, such as productId, productName, and category.
3.	Implementation:
o	Implement linear search and binary search algorithms.
o	Store products in an array for linear search and a sorted array for binary search.
4.	Analysis:
o	Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.
o	Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.
