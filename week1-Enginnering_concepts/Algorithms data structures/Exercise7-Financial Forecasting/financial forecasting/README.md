## Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting

# Scenario: 
You are developing a financial forecasting tool that predicts future values based on past data.

# Steps:
1.	Understand Recursive Algorithms:
o	Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.
2.	Setup:
o	Create a method to calculate the future value using a recursive approach.
3.	Implementation:
o	Implement a recursive algorithm to predict future values based on past growth rates.
4.	Analysis:
o	Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
o	Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
