## JPA 
Java Persistence API (JPA) is a specification (JSR 338) that defines how Java objects should be persisted, retrieved, and managed in a relational database. It provides a standard set of interfaces and annotations for object-relational mapping but does not include any actual implementation. JPA acts as a contract for ORM tools to follow.

## Hibernate
Hibernate is a popular ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that provides a concrete implementation of the JPA specification. It handles the database interactions, mapping Java classes to database tables, and managing CRUD operations. Hibernate offers additional features beyond JPA, such as caching and advanced querying.

## Spring JPA
Spring Data JPA is a Spring framework project that sits on top of JPA implementations like Hibernate. It simplifies data access by reducing boilerplate code through repository interfaces and handles transactions automatically. Spring Data JPA makes it easier for developers to write database operations without dealing directly with EntityManager or Sessions.
